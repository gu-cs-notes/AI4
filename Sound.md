## Wave function
Sound is described mathematically as a wave function. 
The wave function that defines it is in the notes, but the crucial components of it are:

- Amplitude, represented by an 'A'
- Frequency, represented by an 'f'
- Time, represented by a       't'
- The wave's *phase*, represented by a 'rho/arbitrary greek letter'


### Phase
The phase of the wave is the distance from the wave's equilibrium position at the time of origin. 
(It's essentially a sort of distance shifter)


### Other terms
THe oscilation of the molecules produces *local density variations*, and hence *local pressure variations*. These variations are what we interpret as sound.


### Other forms of the ordinary wave equation
There are forms of the wave equation that also specify the maximum pressure, as found in the notes.
